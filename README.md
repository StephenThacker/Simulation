# Simulation
This github repository contains python code demonstrating two and three-dimensional, physics based simulations of a projectile leaving a sling. This model uses the kinematic equations to model the trajectory of a projectile rotating through the sling and then flying through space. In the three dimensional case, the projectile can be controlled with angular forces from multiple orientations, simultaneously.
